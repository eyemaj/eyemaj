- 👋 My name is Les. I use the name, Eyemaj, because I have a creative and imaginary eye on designing and developing applications and websites.
- 👀 I am looking for a professional career in entry level Web Development, Frontend and Backend Development, or Junior Developer with a potential of growing to upper levels.
- 🌱 I have a degree in Software Development. However, I am currently self-teaching myself to keep pace with newer and familiar languages: HTML/5, CSS/3, SASS, jQuery, Javascript, React, Java, Bootstrap, Python, Git, Angular, VUE, JSON, NodeJS, MongoDB, SQL; Operating Systems (Android, Linux, Mac OS, Windows); Systems Administration; and the latest innovations. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on designing and developing some of the best and professional apps and websites. At the moment, I am working on creating samples of my work to post on my Github page.
- 📫 Any interested party can reach me via les.alltech@outlook.com

Thank you!
