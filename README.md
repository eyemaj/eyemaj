- 👋 My name is Les. I use the name, Eyemaj, because I have a creative and imaginary eye on designing and developing websites.
- 👀 I am looking for a professional career in entry level Web Development, Frontend and Backend Development, and Junior Developer with a potential of growing to upper levels.
- 🌱 I have a degree in Software Development. However, I am currently self-teaching myself to keep pace with newer and familiar languages: HTML/5, CSS/3, SASS, jQuery, Javascript, React, Java, Bootstrap, Python, Git, Angular, JSON, MongoDB, SQL; Operating Systems (Andriod, Linux, MacOS, Windows); and the latest innovations. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on designing and developing some of the best and professional apps and websites
- 📫 I can be reached via les.alltech@outlook.com
